# Date-A-Scientist-portfolio-project
This project was the final capstone for codecademy's course "Build a machine Learning Model with Python.

The goal of the project is to use the columns of the dataset provided by OKCupid to find out if there were relationships with one another. For this project, I decided to look for variables that could potentially affect someone's income

The variables I used were education, drinking, drug use, and smoking because they are all lifestyle choices and I was curious to see if any of those variables affected a person's income

As a part of this project, I am also required to do a google slides presentation on my findings. That will be completed later on and a link will be provided in this ReadMe file.
